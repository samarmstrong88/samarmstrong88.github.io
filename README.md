This webpage was created as part of a job Application for Roam Creative in Auckland, New Zealand.

The page is built to be responsive for different devices, using CSS media queries.

The aim was to use as much pure CSS as possible, and the site has only a few lines of javascript for opening and closing the mobile 
navigation bar.
