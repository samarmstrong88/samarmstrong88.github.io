        <p>I’m hoping for the opportunity to work with you as a front-end developer, because I believe that Roam is
          an organisation that focuses firstly on people, then delivers elegant and beautiful solutions through design
          and code. To me, this intesection of people and technology is what makes front end development an amazing
          industry and I believe that I
          would fit right in with that culture.</p>

        <p> I have a strong passion for front-end development, particularly with React/Redux and the associated
          Javascript
          ecosystem. I love the pace that the front-end world is currently advancing at, and the way that our ability
          to
          create wonderful things is constantly increasing. I can tell that Roam keeps up to date with these fast- paced changes,
          which is why  I am looking to continue to expand my skills at Roam,
          alongside an obviously talented and diverse team. </p>

        <p>I would jump at the opportunity to become a part of whatever new projects you have coming up, and I
          believe that I have plenty to offer the team. I’m passionate and excited about web development and my
          perpetual curiosity and ‘always a student’ mentality has developed into my greatest strength as a
          developer: the motivation and ability to continually learn new concepts and keep up to date with this
          ever-changing industry. I've also
          worked in teams and with customers for almost my whole working life, and my communication skills are
          excellent, whether with customers, within a team or with management.</p>

        <p>As part of your front-end team, I am sure that I could quickly develop (no pun intended!) my skills
          even further and become an extremely valuable part of your team. So, I hope to hear from you soon.
          But whatever happens, I’ll be keeping an eye out
          for what Roam is up to next!</p>
        <p>
          Best Regards,
        </p>
        <p>Sam Armstrong</p>
