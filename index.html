      <p>Hi, I'm</p>

      <div class='bio'>
        <p>I’m hoping for the opportunity to work with you as a front-end developer, because from your portfolio of
          work,
          the impression I get is that Roam is an organisation that focuses on people, then delivers elegant and
          beautiful solutions through design and code.To me, this is what makes front end development an amazing
          industry and I believe that I fit right in with that idea.</p>
        <p>Of course, the opportunity to work with some new and interesting technologies is also a huge motivation
          to me. Particularly, the opportunity to keep up with the state of the Javascript ecosystem and other
          front-end tools is exciting, as is the chance to work alongside other interesting technologies like GraphQL
          (I’ve dabbled with it, and think it’s great), IoT, augmented reality and your own Sauce backend, to name a
          few.</p>
        <p>I would jump at the opportunity to become a part of whatever new projects you have coming up, and I
          believe that I have plenty to offer the team. I’m passionate and excited about web development and my
          perpetual curiosity and ‘always a student’ mentality has developed into my greatest strength as a
          developer: the motivation and ability to continually learn new concepts quickly and in detail. I’ve also
          worked or communicated with customers for almost my whole working life, and my communication skills are
          excellent, whether with customers, within a team or with management.</p>
        <p>As part of your front-end team, I am sure that I could quickly develop (no pun intended!) my skills
          even further and become an extremely valuable part of your team, as well as hopefully bring some new \
          skills to the table.So, I hope to hear from you soon. But, whatever happens, I’ll be keeping an eye out
          for what Roam is up to next!</p>
